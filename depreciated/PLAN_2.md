Yes, we can eliminate the diffusion refinement process to keep things simpler and more elegant, relying solely on the autoregressive transformer for generation. Matra-Genoa achieves strong results (16% S.U.N., 8x better than baselines) without any diffusion, using just greedy autoregressive sampling plus post-generation filters (e.g., bond distances <0.7Å, Laplacian connectivity) and cheap uMLIP relaxations (M3GNet/ORBITAL) to boost validity from ~70-80% to practical levels. This avoids multimodal sampling overhead in diffusion while maintaining high throughput (~1000 structs/min). We'll strengthen in-generation constraints (symmetry masking, validity head for reranking) and post-processing (add connectivity check, relaxation) to compensate, targeting similar or better validity (~90%+ after filters) without sacrificing speed.

For property conditioning with potentially incomplete training data, yes, a flexible prefix sequence like [BANDGAP] [1.5] [EHULL] [LOW] works elegantly, directly inspired by Matra-Genoa's EHULL LOW/HIGH prefixes. Missing properties are simply omitted from the sequence (e.g., [EHULL] [LOW] for structures without bandgap). This is end-to-end trainable: Discrete props (e.g., EHULL LOW) use learnable embeddings; continuous (e.g., bandgap 1.5) use Gaussian embeddings. During inference, users specify desired props in prefixes; the model conditions on what's provided, falling back to unconditional priors for absent ones. This handles zero-shot on new props (add to vocab) and avoids separate encoders.

For training on partial properties, we don't need multiple examples per structure or explicit combinations—that would explode data size unnecessarily. Instead, for each structure, create one sequence with prefixes for its available properties (e.g., if it has bandgap and EHULL, include both; if only EHULL, just that). Use property dropout (30% chance to omit available props randomly) during training to simulate partial/missing cases, teaching robustness. This mirrors Matra-Genoa's stability conditioning (train on actual EHULL labels) and ensures the model learns to generate from varied prefix subsets without data duplication.
